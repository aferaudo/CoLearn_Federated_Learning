# Data resulting from tests

This data emerges from some tests applied to the distributed architecture. In particular they include:

- bandwidth test
- cpu test
- time training for each round
- total time of training
- temperature monitoring during training and in idle (consider that the raspberry max temp before thermal throttling is 85 Â°C)

The testing are organized by time. This means that if you need some graphs you must to use the time values (e.g. to consider only the temperature in the training time).

Time of training start:

- Testing 1 (3 Round 1000 max iterations):
  
    - start: 12:13:05, end: 12:13:32
    - start: 12:34:07, end: 12:34:34
    - start: 12:45:38, end: 12:46:05

- Testing 2 (6 Round 1000 max iterations):
    
    - start: 14:11:37, end: 14:12:30
    - start: 14:26:51, end: 14:27:54
